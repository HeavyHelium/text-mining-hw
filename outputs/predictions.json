The magnetic field changes from 1 to -1, so ΔB = 2 Tesla.\nΔΦ = 100 * 1 × 10^-3 * 2 = 0.2 Weber.\n\nThe induced EMF is ε = -ΔΦ/Δt.  Also, ε = IR, where I is the current and R is the resistance.

There are physics notations such as σ (surface charge density), µC (microCoulombs), V (Volts).\n6. The electric field due to an infinite non-conducting sheet is given by E = σ / (2 * ε0), where ε0 is the permittivity of free space (8.85 x 10^-12 C^2/Nm^2). The potential difference between two points is given by V = E * d, where d is the distance. We have σ = 0.10 µC/m^2 = 0.10 x 10^-6 C/m^2 and V = 50 V.

The problem states that a ball collides with a frictionless floor at an angle of 45 degrees, with a coefficient of restitution of 1/2. The fraction of kinetic energy lost is to be determined.\nLet the initial velocity of the ball be v. Then the initial kinetic energy is (1/2)mv^2.\nSince the floor is frictionless, the horizontal component of velocity doesn't change during the impact.\nThe vertical component of velocity becomes e times its initial value, where e is the coefficient of restitution.\nGiven that the angle of incidence is 45 degrees, the initial horizontal and vertical components of velocity are equal, i.e., vx = vy = v/sqrt(2).\nAfter the collision, vx' = vx = v/sqrt(2) and vy' = e vy = (1/2) v/sqrt(2).\nThe final kinetic energy is (1/2)m (vx'^2 + vy'^2) = (1/2)m [(v/sqrt(2))^2 + ((1/2) v/sqrt(2))^2]\n= (1/2)m [v^2/2 + v^2/8] = (1/2)m (5v^2/8) = (5/8) * (1/2)mv^2.\nThe initial kinetic energy is (1/2)mv^2.\nThe kinetic energy lost is (1/2)mv^2 - (5/8)(1/2)mv^2 = (3/8)(1/2)mv^2.\nThe fraction of kinetic energy lost is [(3/8)(1/2)mv^2] / [(1/2)mv^2] = 3/8.\n\nB",

The initial momentum of the cannonball at the highest point is given by the horizontal component of its initial velocity, which is $200 \\cos(60^\\circ) = 200 * 0.5 = 100$ m/s.\nSince the masses are equal, $m_1 = m_2 = m_3 = m$. The initial momentum $P_{initial} = 3m * 100 = 300m$\nThe momentum of fragment 1, $P_1 = m * 100$ upwards. The momentum of fragment 2, $P_2 = m* (-100)$ downwards.\n$P_3$ is the momentum of fragment 3. Then, $P_{initial} = P_1 + P_2 + P_3$. Therefore $300m = m(100) + m(-100) + P_3$, which implies $P_3 = 300m$. The velocity of the third fragment is therefore $\\frac{300m}{m} = 300 m/s$ in the horizontal direction.\n7.

Let the distance traveled by A in the 5th second be $d_A$ and the distance traveled by B in the 5th second be $d_B$.

The distance traveled by B in 3 seconds is $s_{B3} = \\frac{1}{2} a_2 (3)^2 = \\frac{9}{2} a_2$.

Question Text: The displacement x of a particle varies with time t, x = ae^{-αt} + be^{βt}, where a, b, α and β are positive constants. The velocity of the particle will...\n3. Answer Choices:\n    (A) Go on decreasing with time\n    (B) Be independent of α and β\n    (C) Drop to zero when α = β\n    (D) Go on increasing with time\n4.  The equation x = ae^{-αt} + be^{βt} describes the displacement. Velocity is the derivative of displacement with respect to time.\n5.  Multilingual aspect: None. The text is in English and includes standard mathematical notation.\n6.  We have to differentiate x with respect to t. v = dx/dt = -αae^{-αt} + βbe^{βt}. Since βbe^{βt} will increase with increasing time, and the other component will decrease with time, and since both constants are positive, the velocity will go on increasing with time.\n7.  Based on the analysis above, the correct answer is (D).\n\nD",

There is no multilingual text. However, the problem uses scientific notation (N for Newton and m/s² for meters per second squared).\n6. To find the acceleration, first find the mass. Weight (W) = mg, where g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s²). So, mass (m) = W/g = 10 N / 9.8 m/s² ≈ 1.02 kg.\nThen, use Newton's second law: F = ma, where F is the force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration. Thus, a = F/m = 5 N / 1.02 kg ≈ 4.9 m/s².\nThe closest answer to the calculated value is 5 m/s².\n\nB",

The image contains text describing a physics problem related to a conducting ring and a battery. There are four answer choices given.\n2. Question: The value of the magnetic induction at the centre due to the current in the ring is\n3.  Answer choices:\n    A. Proportional to 2(180° - θ)\n    B. Inversely proportional to r\n    C. Zero only if θ = 180°\n    D. Zero for all values of θ\n4. There are no additional visual elements such as tables, diagrams, charts, or graphs.\n5.  There are mathematical notations in the text.\n6.  Analysis: The problem describes a conducting ring with a battery connected at two points, A and B. The arc AB subtends an angle θ at the center.  The magnetic field due to the two arcs will be in opposite directions. The magnetic field at the center of a current loop is proportional to the current and inversely proportional to the radius. The current distribution in the two arcs will depend on the resistances. The resistance is proportional to the length of the arc.  If θ = 180°, the two arcs will have equal length, and the currents will be equal. Therefore, the magnetic fields due to each arc will be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Thus the net magnetic field will be zero. Now consider the case when θ is not 180°. The currents will be different and thus the magnetic fields will be different and the net magnetic field will not be zero. Based on this reasoning, answer (D) is incorrect and (C) might be a good answer. But when the points A and B coincide (θ=0° or θ=360°) all the current flows along the ring and the resulting magnetic field is non-zero.\n\nHowever, according to Biot-Savart law, the magnetic field at the center due to an arc of a circle is given by B = (μ₀Iθ)/(4πr), where θ is the angle subtended by the arc at the center in radians. Here, the angle subtended by one arc is θ and the angle subtended by the other arc is 2π - θ. If currents I₁ and I₂ flow through these arcs respectively, then the net magnetic field at the center is given by B = (μ₀I₁θ)/(4πr) - (μ₀I₂(2π - θ))/(4πr).\nWhen θ=π (180°), I₁=I₂, B=0. So, it will be zero only when θ=180°.\n7. Correct answer is C.\n8.\nC",

The question uses physics notation.\n6. The problem is to calculate the stopping potential, V0, given the maximum velocity of the emitted electron, v = 4 x 10^8 cm/s = 4 x 10^6 m/s, and the electron mass, m = 9 x 10^-31 kg. The kinetic energy, KE, is given by KE = 1/2 * m * v^2. The stopping potential is related to the kinetic energy by KE = e * V0, where e is the elementary charge (e = 1.6 x 10^-19 C). Thus, V0 = KE / e = (1/2 * m * v^2) / e.\n\nV0 = (0.5 * 9 x 10^-31 kg * (4 x 10^6 m/s)^2) / (1.6 x 10^-19 C)\nV0 = (0.5 * 9 x 10^-31 * 16 x 10^12) / (1.6 x 10^-19)\nV0 = (72 x 10^-19) / (1.6 x 10^-19)\nV0 = 72 / 1.6 = 45 V\n\n7.

The fraction of the substance remaining after n half-lives is (1/2)^n.\nFor alpha decay, 80 years is 80/40 = 2 half-lives, so the fraction remaining is (1/2)^2 = 1/4.\nFor beta decay, 80 years is 80/20 = 4 half-lives, so the fraction remaining is (1/2)^4 = 1/16.\nSince both decays happen simultaneously, the fraction remaining is (1/4)*(1/16) = 1/64.\nThe fraction decayed is 1 - (fraction remaining) = 1 - (1/64) = 63/64.\n7.

Relevant Physics Concepts:\n   - The intensity of light is proportional to the square of the amplitude.\n   - When coherent waves superpose, the resultant amplitude is the sum of individual amplitudes when in phase and the difference when out of phase.\n   - Imax = (√I1 + √I2)^2 and Imin = (√I1 - √I2)^2\n5. Analysis\n   - The amplitudes of the two light beams are √I and √(4I) = 2√I.\n   - The maximum intensity will occur when the waves interfere constructively (amplitudes add up):\n     Imax = (√I + 2√I)^2 = (3√I)^2 = 9I.\n   - The minimum intensity will occur when the waves interfere destructively (amplitudes subtract):\n     Imin = (√I - 2√I)^2 = (-√I)^2 = I.\n   - Therefore, the maximum and minimum intensities are 9I and I, respectively.\n\n6.

Answer Choices:\n    - (a) 1.2 cm\n    - (b) 1.2 mm\n    - (c) 2.4 cm\n    - (d) 2.4 mm\n4.  No diagrams or graphs are present.\n5.  The text is in English, and contains standard physics notation.\n6.  We need to calculate the distance between the first minima on either side of the central maximum in a single-slit diffraction pattern. The angular position of the first minimum is given by sin(theta) = lambda/a, where lambda is the wavelength and a is the slit width. The distance y from the center to the first minimum is given by y = D * tan(theta), where D is the distance to the screen. Since lambda << a, we can approximate sin(theta) ≈ tan(theta) ≈ theta. Thus y = D * lambda/a. The distance between the first minima on either side of the central maximum is 2y = 2 * D * lambda/a.\n    Plugging in the values:\n    lambda = 600 nm = 600 * 10^-9 m\n    a = 1 mm = 1 * 10^-3 m\n    D = 2 m\n    2y = 2 * 2 * 600 * 10^-9 / 10^-3 = 4 * 600 * 10^-6 = 2400 * 10^-6 m = 2.4 * 10^-3 m = 2.4 mm\n7.

The image contains text describing a container with water and an object above the water surface. The bottom of the container is a perfectly reflecting plane.\n2. Question Text: A container has a perfectly reflecting plane bottom. It is filled with water (μ = 4/3) up to a height 20cm. An object is kept at a height 15 cm above the surface of water. Distance of the final image from water surface is\n3. Answer Choices:\n    - (a) 50 cm\n    - (b) 60 cm\n    - (c) 35 cm\n    - (d) 45 cm\n4. There are no visual elements like tables or diagrams.\n5. The question is in English with some physics notation.\n6. The question describes a container filled with water, with a reflecting bottom. An object is placed above the water, and the problem asks for the distance of the final image from the water surface.\n\nFirst, consider the object at 15 cm above the water surface. Due to refraction at the water surface, the image is formed at a depth of $d' = \\frac{d}{\\mu} = \\frac{20}{4/3} = 15$ cm. This image acts as an object for reflection at the bottom surface which is at a distance of 15 + 20 = 35 cm. Due to reflection at the bottom surface, the image is formed at the same distance behind the mirror. So the image is at a distance of 35 cm below the bottom surface. The distance of this image from the water surface is 35+20 = 55 cm. Now, this acts as an object inside water at 20 cm from the water surface and 35 cm from reflecting surface. Due to refraction at the water surface, the final image is formed at a height of $\\mu h = (4/3) * 35 = 140/3 = 46.66 cm$ which has no answer close to it.  The height of the object from water surface is 15 cm. After refraction, its image will be 15 * (4/3) = 20cm. This means the image will coincide with the bottom. This is an object for the mirror, and its image will be 20cm below the mirror, which means 40 cm from the surface. after refraction this will become 40 * 3/4 = 30 cm. Let's consider the other image. The object in water will be 20/ (4/3) = 15cm from surface, then mirror image is 15+20 = 35 away. 35+20 = 55 away from surface. After refraction, it is 55*3/4 = 41.25.\nBased on these approximations, the closest answer is 45.\n\nD",

The Rayleigh criterion states that the minimum angular separation between two objects that can be resolved is given by θ = 1.22λ/D, where λ is the wavelength of light and D is the diameter of the telescope's objective lens. The distance between the objects, d, can be approximated as d = θL, where L is the distance to the objects.\nGiven:\nλ = 5000 Å = 5000 * 10^-10 m = 5 * 10^-7 m\nD = 10 cm = 0.1 m\nL = 1 km = 1000 m\n\nFirst, we calculate the angular resolution:\nθ = 1.22λ/D = 1.22 * (5 * 10^-7 m) / (0.1 m) = 6.1 * 10^-6 radians\n\nNow, we calculate the minimum distance between the objects:\nd = θL = (6.1 * 10^-6) * 1000 m = 6.1 * 10^-3 m = 6.1 mm\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n(a) 0.6 m\n(b) 6 m\n(c) 6 mm\n(d) 6 cm = 60 mm\n\nThe calculated distance (6.1 mm) is closest to option (c) 6 mm.\n\nC",

Since the mass (m) doubles and the amplitude (A) remains constant, we also need to consider the effect on the angular frequency ω.  Since ω = sqrt(k/m) where k is the spring constant, if mass doubles then ω becomes ω/sqrt(2). Substituting these values, we have E' = (1/2) * (2m) * (ω/sqrt(2))^2 * A^2 = (1/2) * 2m * (ω^2 / 2) * A^2 = (1/2) * m * ω^2 * A^2 = E\n\n5.  No multilingual or multidomain aspects are present.

There are no additional visual elements.\n5. The image contains text in English and uses mathematical notation for the lengths.\n6.  Let $T_1$ be the period of the pendulum with length $l_1 = 1.44$ m and $T_2$ be the period of the pendulum with length $l_2 = 1$ m. The period of a simple pendulum is given by $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{l}{g}}$. So, $T_1 = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{1.44}{g}}$ and $T_2 = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{g}}$.  The ratio of the periods is $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.44}{1}} = \\sqrt{1.44} = 1.2 = \\frac{6}{5}$.  This means that $5T_1 = 6T_2$. The pendulum with length 1.44 m is the bigger pendulum. The pendulum with length 1 m is the smaller pendulum. Thus, after 5 oscillations of the bigger pendulum and 6 oscillations of the smaller pendulum, they will swing together again.\n7. Since we are looking for the number of oscillations, and the options are in terms of oscillations of the smaller and bigger pendulums. From our analysis in step 6, we have the larger pendulum undergoing 5 oscillations when the smaller pendulum undergoes 6 oscillations. Therefore option C is not suitable as the number of oscillations is 4 for the bigger pendulum. Similarly, Option D is incorrect as the number of oscillations is 6 for bigger pendulum. Option A provides 5 oscillations for the smaller pendulum which is not supported from the result derived above. Option B looks suitable as 6 oscillations of smaller pendulum.

Similarly, K.E.max = 100 J.\nSo if total mechanical energy is 100J then Option A and B will be correct.\nLooking at the choices again, the best one is d.\n\nD",

Since the pressure of one bubble is three times that of the other, P1 = 3P2. This means 4T/r1 = 3(4T/r2), so r2 = 3r1. The volume (V) of a sphere (bubble) is (4/3)πr^3. Thus, V1/V2 = (r1^3) / (r2^3) = (r1^3) / (3r1)^3 = 1/27.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (c).\n\nC",
